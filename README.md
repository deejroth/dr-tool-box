===========

Tools I created cause I needed them at the time or was bored. Please feel free to contribute or provide feedback!  
 PS-Feedback is another way to say constructive criticism, no need to poke fun! It would be better to point out an issue and suggest a good fix.
 
===========

- Peasy Framework: A super easy to use php framework (just started, don't use it! But feel free to provide feedback)
  - This project is more of a proof of concept than anything else
  - Decided to make this because I was bored on a Sunday morning
  - Uses [Kube](http://imperavi.com/kube/) for the css
- LoremPixel class, generate images quickly with the [LoremPixel](http://lorempixel.com) service
  - 1st, please note that I did not make the service, just this class
  - I made this class becuase I really like the service and use it quite often
  - Also, I needed some more practice on writing and optimizing OO code
  - I am not a pro OO coder, and would love some feedback on this
